# Basic React, Babel and Webpack Build

This project was set up as a very basic example of how to configure a React app using Webpack and Babel. Some of the features of this build include:

- JS/JSX loading
  - Including extensions
  - ES6 and React support
- CSS loading
  - Including CSS modules
- SVG loading (among other file types)
- Dev server
- Source mapping (depending on build mode)

## Babel Setup

- `@babel/core`
  - Transpile ES6 code to ES5
- `babel-loader`
  - Webpack helper that uses Babel for transpiling through Webpack
- `@babel/preset-env`
  - Determines features that need to be transformed for different browsers/runtimes
  - Browser polyfills
- `@babel/preset-react`
  - Transforms React JSX into functions

## Webpack Setup

It is possible to have multiple Webpack configs and point the relevant config when building, e.g. for production or development. `webpack-merge` can be used to combine specific configs with common ones. It should be noted that Webpack rules appear as though in "reverse" as Webpack uses a nested model, rather than a sequential one, this is explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43472333/webpack-2-loaders-declared-in-reverse). Below, are outlined the fields used in this Webpack setup:

### Common Config

- `entry`
  - The main file of your application
- `output`
  - `path`
    - The destination folder for the bundle
  - `filename`
    - The name of the bundle file
- `rules`
  - The way we tell Webpack how to bundle different types of files:
    1. Uses `babel-loader` to convert .js and .jsx files from ES6 and React JSX
    2. Uses `style-loader` takes a CSS string from .css files (generated by the next rule) and injects them into `<style>` tags in `index.html`
    3. Uses `css-loader` to convert .css files into a string (also set up to allow CSS Modules)
        - `localIdentName` specifies the transformed name for the CSS class
        - `localsConvention` specifies the style export class name
    4. Uses `file-loader` on .eot, .tff, .svg, .woff and .woff2 files to resolve imports/requires
        - Specifies a hashed name/location for the resolved files
- `extensions`
  - Automatically resolves .js and .jsx extensions so they don't need to be included in imports/requires

### Development Config

- `mode`
  - Sets Webpack mode to "development"
- `devtool`
  - Sets up source mapping development builds
- `devserver`
  - Settings for `webpack-dev-server`
    - `contentBase`
      - Specifies from where the dev server should serve the files
    - `port`
      - The port on which the server should run
    - `open`
      - Whether or not starting the server should open a browser tab on the relevant port
    - `hot`
      - Enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR), allowing modules to be updated at runtime without needing a full refresh

### Production Config

- `mode`
  - Sets Webpack mode to "production"

## Tutorial

Follow the git tags (from the tutorial branch) for a step-by-step approach to configuring this project:

1. Basic React app with no CSS
2. CSS importing
3. CSS Modules
4. Loading files (SVG in this tutorial)
5. Resolving file extensions
6. Separating Webpack configs
7. Using kebab case with CSS Modules
